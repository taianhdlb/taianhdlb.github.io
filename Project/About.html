                                            the best trips. Sushan dai was very helpful and he organized our stay in
                                            comfortable hotels with pick up and drops. Despite a one day extension in
                                            our trip he promptly arranged our stay and travel. The best thing about
                                            Namaste Nepal Travels is that it is reasonably priced...I highly recommend

                                    leisure to their summer homes and villas in cities such as Pompeii and Baiae. While

                                    migration, cultural and technological advances over many years have tended to mean

                                    1492, an expedition which took over 10 weeks to arrive at the final destination; to
                                    the 21st century where aircraft allow travel from Spain to the United States

                <p>Travel dates back to antiquity where wealthy Greeks and Romans would travel for leisure to their
                    summer homes and villas in cities such as Pompeii and Baiae. While early travel tended to be slower,
                    more dangerous, and more dominated by trade and migration, cultural and technological advances over
                    many years have tended to mean that travel has become easier and more accessible. Mankind has come a
                    long way in transportation since Christopher Columbus sailed to the new world from Spain in 1492, an
                    expedition which took over 10 weeks to arrive at the final destination; to the 21st century where
                    aircraft allow travel from Spain to the United States overnight.</p>

                    <p>Travel in the Middle Ages offered hardships and challenges, however, it was important to the
                        economy and to society. The wholesale sector depended (for example) on merchants dealing
                        with/through caravans or sea-voyagers, end-user retailing often demanded the services of many
                        itinerant peddlers wandering from village to hamlet, gyrovagues (Wandering Monks) and wandering
                        friars brought theology and pastoral support to neglected areas, traveling minstrels practiced
                        the never-ending tour, and armies ranged far and wide in various crusades and in sundry other
                        wars. Pilgrimages were common in both the European and Islamic worlds and involved streams of
                        travelers both locally (Canterbury Tales-style) and internationally.</p><cite>Story

                <p>In the late 16th century it became fashionable for young European aristocrats and wealthy upper-class
                    men to travel to significant European cities as part of their education in the arts and literature.
                    This was known as the Grand Tour, it included cities such as London, Paris, Venice, Florence, and
                    Rome. However, The French revolution brought with it the end of the Grand Tour.</p>
                <p>Travel by water often provided more comfort and speed than land-travel, at least until the advent of
                    a network of railways in the 19th century. Travel for the purpose of tourism is reported to have
                    started around this time when people began to travel for fun as travel was no longer a hard and
                    challenging task. This was capitalized on by people like Thomas Cook selling tourism packages where
                    trains and hotels were booked together. Airships and airplanes took over much of the role of
                    long-distance surface travel in the 20th century, notably after the Second World War where there was
                    a surplus of both aircraft and pilots. Indeed, air travel has become so ubiquitous in the 21st
                    century that one woman, Alexis Alford, visited all 196 countries before the age of 21.</p>
